## React Crash Course Project 

This is a very simple react project, not too dissimilar to a typical to-do list Single Page Application (SPA). This project was built following the instructions in the (Udemy Course Next.js & React - The Complete Guide)[https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide] by Maxmilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller under *Section 2: Optional: React Refresher. 

This project goes through some fundamental React features alongside some very useful React Libraries namely (React Router)[https://reactrouter.com/]. The features are not limited to but include the following: 
> Components

> Dynamic Values

> useState, useEffect ( Built-in React Hooks )

> useLoaderData, useNavigate ( React Router Hooks )

This project is dependent on a Node.JS simple backend server which should be ran on the same device. You can find Maximilian's backend application developed for this project (here!)[https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/blob/zz-reactjs-summary-updated/extra-files/dummy-backend.zip]
